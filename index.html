            <p>Hi, my name is Paige, and I am the creator of the DailyTeaCup website. I play Go at a high level and am very passionate about the game. My enthusiasm for the Go community has inspired me to create a project for the community. I'm a social and outgoing person with a range of hobbies. While Go is my main passion, I also enjoy blogging photography, and exploring web design. During the day, I work in real estate customer experience. In my off-hours, when I'm not engaged in my hobbies, you can usually find me goofing off and hanging out with friends in Discord calls.</p></td>
